The fundamental insight highlighted by the above quotation underpins much work
done in \cite{jones-1999, jones-2001, kristiansen-voda-2005, hofmann-2003,
kristiansen-2008}, and of course, \cite{jones-kristiansen-2009}, among others.
We draw on this insight in a fundamental and perhaps extreme way, by taking the
notion of ``successor-like function'' to roughly mean ``enumerator'', and
consider the presence and absence of both particular successor-like \emph{and}
predecessor-like functions.

Implicit characterizations of complexity classes, e.g. PTIME, often start out
by considering first-order programs on natural numbers. That is, the
computation of (mathematical) functions of type $\mathbb{N} \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}$. (For a counterexample, see \cite{hofmann-2003}.) 

In lieu of \refThm{tm-total}, such results apply even if we replace
$\mathbb{N}$ (on either side) by any countable or countably infinite set. That
is, the results still hold even if we turn to the computation of (mathematical)
functions of type $A \rightarrow B$ for some countable or countably infinite
sets $A$ and $B$.

Crucially, \refThm{tm-total} relies on \emph{mathematical} functions, not
real-world transformations. Realistically, all we get is this: assuming that we
have a representation of a value of type $A$ as a natural number, we can
compute a natural number representation of the corresponding value of type $B$,
within the characterised bounds.

This outset of ``first-order programs on natural numbers'' ignores the
real-life hurdle of dealing with \emph{data structures} rather than natural
numbers. So such an exposition is arguably impractical, or more dramatically,
ignores certain \emph{complexities} involved in dealing with data.

Instead, we formalise a notion of ``successor'' and ``predecessor'', and
present seminal results in the characterisation of PTIME in terms of this
general framework. Informally, a successor or predecessor is any operation that
may change the size of any value in the program (including time?). In practice,
essentially any conceivable operation, except perhaps stalling.

\section{Programs}

% Many high-level programming languages have data types, and these data types
% cannot be coerced.

In the interest of capturing a wide range of programming paradigms in one
discussion, we give only a general specification of what we deem a program to
be. This specification will later be specialized for more concrete purposes. We
make no claim however, that in so doing, we capture all conceivable programming
paradigms.

\begin{specification}

A \textbf{program} $P = \p{P_\mathbf{D}, P_\mathbf{F}}$ is a finite set of
\textbf{data types} $P_\mathbf{D}$, and a finite set of \textbf{functions}
$P_\mathbf{F}$, subject to the following laws:

\begin{enumerate}

\item [P-1] Every data type $A \in P_\mathbf{D}$ forms a set.

\item [P-2] Every function $f \in P_\mathbf{F}$ computes a partial function $f
: A \rightharpoonup B$, for some $A, B\in P_\mathbf{D}$. We write $f : A
\rightharpoonup B \in P_\mathbf{F}$.

\item [P-3] For every data type $A \in P_\mathbf{D}$ there is a \textbf{size
function} $\card{\cdot} : A \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, so for every $a \in A$ we
have $\card{a} \in \mathbb{N}$.

\end{enumerate}

\end{specification}

\begin{remark} We do not require that a function $f \in P_\mathbf{F}$ can
compute a partial function $f : A \rightharpoonup B$ between \emph{any} given
data types $A, B \in P_\mathbf{D}$, merely that it is a partial function
between \emph{some} given data types $A, B \in P_\mathbf{D}$.  \end{remark}

\begin{remark} The purpose of the size function is primarily semantic, and so
it need not be in $P_\mathbf{F}$, but of course, it could be. \end{remark}

\subsection{Successors and Predecessors}

\begin{definition} A partial function $s : X \rightharpoonup Y \in
P_\mathbf{F}$ is a \textbf{successor function} for some $x \in X$ iff $s\p{x}$
is defined and $\card{x} < \card{s\p{x}}$. \end{definition}

\begin{definition} A partial function $p : X \rightharpoonup Y \in
P_\mathbf{F}$ is a \textbf{predecesor function} for some $x \in X$ iff $p\p{x}$
is defined and $\card{p\p{x}} < \card{x}$. \end{definition}

That is, a successor function produces an output \emph{strictly greater} in
size than its input, and a predecessor function produces an output
\emph{strictly lesser} in size than its input.

Note in particular, that whether a given partial function $f : X
\rightharpoonup Y \in P_\mathbf{F}$ is a successor or predecessor function, if
either, \emph{depends} on the value $x \in X$ which $f$ is applied to. If $X$
is a countably infinite data type, there may exist functions which are
successor functions, \emph{independent} of the value that they are applied to.

\begin{definition} A partial function $c : X \rightharpoonup Y \in
P_\mathbf{F}$, is a \textbf{constructor} iff $X$ is the domain of definition of
$c$, so $c : X \rightarrow Y \in P_\mathbf{F}$, and $c$ is a successor function
\emph{for all} $x \in X$. \end{definition}

On the other hand, for any data type $X$, there must exist some value $x \in
X$, for which any given function is \emph{not} a predecessor function, as
otherwise there would be a natural number less than $0$.

\subsection{Defining Functions}

For the purposes of a further discussion about programming, we adopt an
equational programming style, in line with classical recursion theory and
functional programming.

\begin{definition} For any program $P = \p{P_\mathbf{D}, P_\mathbf{F}}$, let
$P_\mathbf{F}$ form the \textbf{signature} of $P$, that is, for every $f : X
\rightharpoonup Y \in P_\mathbf{F}$, we say that $f$ is a \textbf{symbol}, and
$X \rightharpoonup Y$ is the \textbf{arity} of symbol $f$. \end{definition}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{variable} $v$ of type $Y \in P_\mathbf{D}$, is a
symbol $v$, which does not occur in $P_\mathbf{F}$. \end{definition}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{term} $t$ of type $Y$, written $t : Y$, is either
a variable $t \equiv v$, or a \textbf{compound term} $t \equiv f\p{x}$, where
$f : X \rightharpoonup Y$ and $x \in X$. \end{definition} 

\begin{definition} A \textbf{ground term} $t : Y$, is a either a variable $t
\equiv v$, or a compound term $t \equiv f\p{x}$, where $f : X \rightharpoonup
Y$ is a \emph{constructor} and $x : X$ is also a \emph{ground term}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} If $x$ is a ground term and $y$ is a term, then $x \leadsto
y$ is a \textbf{clause}.  \end{definition}

\begin{remark} We deviate from the classical use of the symbol $=$ (equals),
frequent in recursion theory and functional programming. We are not concerned
with any notion of ``equality'' between the left- and right-hand side of a
clause. Instead, a clause should state how the left-hand side \emph{leads to}
the right hand side. That is, we have chosen which way evaluation flows. To the
acute reader this sounds an awful lot like term-rewriting, and though it is, we
see no need to dive further into term-rewriting terminology. \end{remark}

\begin{definition} A function is given by a finite set of clauses, where no
pair of left-hand sides unify using the conventional algorithm.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Examples}

\begin{example} Peano numbers in one programming language or another. Model
theory? \end{example}

\subsection{Programming with algebraic data types}

To this end we adopt the notation of \cite{marion-2003}.

\begin{definition} A \textbf{sort} $\mathcal{S}$ is a set. \end{definition}

\begin{specification} The set of \textbf{types} $\mathcal{T}$ over a sort
$\mathcal{S}$ is  built from either the elements of $\mathcal{S}$ or
\textbf{type constructors}. \end{specification}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{vocabulary} is a set of symbols \end{definition} 

We follow the approach and notation of \cite{clote-1999}, where many of the
below results are presented using a single-sorted word algebra. We consider
generalizing the presentation to many-sorted algebras where this has already
been done by others, and otherwise.

A recursion scheme will be given over a particular algebra, where an algebra is
given over a signature.

\begin{definition} A \textbf{signature} is a triple $\Sigma = \p{\mathbf{B},
\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{C}}$, where

\begin{enumerate}

\item [$\mathbf{B}$] is a set of \textbf{base types},

\item [$\mathbf{T}$] is a set of \textbf{type constructors}, and

\item [$\mathbf{V}$] is a set of \textbf{value constructors}.

\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

The set of base types and type constructors can be deduced from the set of
value constructors in a signature. We choose to mark these elements in a
distinct manner to make the following notions straight forward to discuss.

\begin{definition} A signature is \textbf{single-sorted} if it has exactly one
base type $B$, written $\Sigma = \p{\set{B}, -, -}$. A signature that is not
single-sorted is \textbf{many-sorted}.  \end{definition}

\begin{definition} For a set of base types $\mathbf{B}$, let $*$ denote any
base type in $\mathbf{B}$. \end{definition}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{word} signature is a signature having just the
type constructors $*$ and $* \rightarrow *$, written $\p{\mathbf{B}, \set{*, *
\rightarrow *}, \mathbf{V}}$.  \end{definition}

% \begin{example} A single-sorted word signature is a signature $\p{\set{B},
% \set{*, * \rightarrow *}, \mathbf{V}}$. That is, for each $v \in \mathbf{V}$
% we either have $v : B$ or $v : B\rightarrow B$. \end{example}

As an example, we now turn to the Peano numbers:

\begin{definition} The \textbf{Peano numbers} is the single-sorted word
signature

$$\Pi \triangleq \p{\set{N}, \set{*, * \rightarrow *}, \set{\mathtt{z} : N,
\mathtt{s} : N \rightarrow N}}.$$

\end{definition}

% \begin{definition} A \textbf{tree} algebra is an algebra having the type
% constructors $\mathbf{T} = \set{*, \mathbf{T} \rightarrow \mathbf{T}}$,
% written $\p{\mathbf{B}, \mathbf{T} = \set{*, \mathbf{T} \rightarrow
% \mathbf{T}}, \mathbf{V}}$. \end{definition}

% \begin{example} A single-sorted binary tree algebra is an algebra over the
% signature $\p{\set{B}, \set{*, * \rightarrow * \rightarrow *}, \mathbf{V}}$,
% where for each $v \in \mathbf{V}$ we either have $v : B$ or $v : B\rightarrow
% B \rightarrow B$. \end{example}

\begin{definition} The set of \textbf{$n$-ary} value constructors over $\Sigma
= \p{-, -, \mathbf{V}}$ is

$$\mathbf{V}_n \triangleq \set{v \in \mathbf{V} \st{v : *_0 \rightarrow *_1
\rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow *_n}}$$

\end{definition}

\begin{definition} The set of \textbf{constructor terms} over
$\Sigma=\p{-, -, \mathbf{V}}$ is

$$\mathcal{C}_\Sigma \triangleq \set{v\p{t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n} \st{n \in
\mathbb{N} \wedge v \in \mathbf{V}_n \wedge t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n \in
\mathcal{C}_\Sigma}}$$

\end{definition}

\begin{example} The set of constructor terms over the Peano numbers is

$$\mathcal{C}_\Pi = \set{\mathtt{z}, \mathtt{s}\p{\mathtt{z}},
\mathtt{s}\p{\mathtt{s}\p{\mathtt{z}}},
\mathtt{s}\p{\mathtt{s}\p{\mathtt{s}\p{\mathtt{z}}}}, \ldots}$$

\end{example}

% recursive call stack

% purely functional programs? no data other than what you put in.

% Perhaps a neat way of categorise the wealth of data structures 

% We take a programming languages approach, and in the process relax a couple
% terms from modern programming nomenclature.

% \begin{definition} A \textbf{program} is a countable set of functions.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition} For a given program, let the \textbf{$A$-valued functions}
% be all the functions in $P$ with codomain $A$. \end{definition}

% \begin{definition} A \textbf{data type} $A$ is given by a subset $S$ of the
% $A$-valued functions $T$, such that all functions in $T \setminus S$ return
% values constructed using functions in $S$. The functions in $S$ are called
% \textbf{value constructors}. \end{definition}

% \begin{remark} Typically, the value constructors are defined in a language
% using designated syntax. \end{remark}

% \begin{remark} For the functional programmer this is a degeneration of the
% common term ``value constructor''. For her, a data type is defined by a
% finite set of well-placed value constructors, and can only be constructed
% using these value constructors. Value constructors are $O(1)$-time and
% $O(1)$-space operations, each having an inverse ``value deconstructor'' for
% use in e.g.  pattern matching. For the imperative programmer, this is a
% degeneration of the common term ``constructor''. Here we lend the term from
% C++, where a type can have multiple constructors taking an arbitrarily long
% time and space, and having at least one common (but perhaps multiple)
% inverses. \end{remark}

% Typically a value constructor has an inverse: a value deconstructor.

% In the presence of successors without pairing predecessors, we must do away
% with such notions.

% \begin{notation} Let $P_\mathbf{D}$ denote the data types induced by the
% functions of program $P$, that is, the set of all codomains in $P$.
% \end{notation}

% \begin{definition} A value constructor is a \textbf{successor} \end{definition} 

% Cobham: Let a function $f$ be defined by a range of base case clauses, and a
% range of deconstructor clauses. The recursive clauses may use various
% predecessor operations.

% Size is always given relative to a particular predecessor operation.

% Consider the predecessor (among those used in the function) that decreases
% the value by the least amount. Assume that the predecessors are always
% applicable to a given value, and that by iterated use of the predecessor, we
% reach a base case. A function is defined by bounded primitive recursion, if
% the number of applications of this most-basic predecessor is no more than as
% given by the given bound.

% Also, better suited as an introduction as it doesn't really say anything
% about the choice of polynomial time from the get go. That's more a
% coincidence, the following definitions will hold regardless. Perhaps it is
% worth it calling this a Part I: Introduction and Background

% Fragment of a logic means that we are restricted to a subset of the syntax,
% but retain the same semantics. If we choose the combination of words -
% subsystem of system, we are perhaps a little more free, but in either case,
% we probably have to further specify what we keep and what we take out.

% for the purposes of this thesis, we may regard logical systems equivalent to
% programming languages - draw inspiration from Types of Crash Prevention - it
% has a nice, human readable introduction to the whole thing.

% The correspondence between an ICC system and a complexity class is
% extensional, i.e. the class of function (or problems) representable in the
% system equals the complexity class.

% by this point we should have more precisely defined the notions of function
% and problem.

% The systems that we will consider here will be subsystems of a larger base
% system, in which other functions, besides those in the complexity class of
% the system can be represented.

% \begin{definition} \textit{Intensional soundness}

% Any program representable in the ICC system, is within the given complexity
% class. Proven by showing equivalence of the class of problems to a complexity
% class.

% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition} \textit{Intensional completeness}

% All functions in the complexity class are representable in the ICC system.

% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition} \textit{Extensional soundness}

% All functions in the complexity class are representable in the base system.

% \end{definition}




% we want natural numbers, but we don't want the successor and predecessor
% operations to always be blindly permitted.

% primitive recursion is really defined in terms of a predecessor operation, at
% least if we assume the successor operation to merely be something that can
% construct a "bigger" value. otherwise, it is undefined how in primitive
% recursion we first compute the lower-order value.

% we run into the same problem with s_1 and s_0! Does it at all make sense to
% define a successor without a predecessor? At least not if we want to be able
% to define functions recursively! Any time we define a function computing a
% bigger value having a lower value, we need to specify it in terms of
% predecessors!

% decrement on binary notation is a polynomial-time operation if we only assume
% s_0 and s_1 (or rather, their predecessors). We can assume dec to be a
% unit-cost operation, and that is where the problems of primitive recursion
% creep up.

% although we can always convert a unique string to a unique natural number, it
% may take a long time to do so. Furthermore, the successor operation is a
% polynomial time oper

% Any more definite attempt at a definition of the natural numbers seems to
% arrive at a philosophical impasse.

% The natural numbers have never-the-less shown to be of prime importance due to
% the concept of recursive enumerability.

% Use sets rather than ``language'' to avoid mixing up inputs/outputs of
% machines and the programming languages that we design. Languages refer
% specifically to sets of strings.

% \begin{definition}

% Define enumerator.

% \end{definition}

% \begin{definition}

% Define recursively enumerable sets.

% \end{definition}

% Dealing with natural numbers is bad as we would quickly regard the successor
% (and predecessor) operations to be paired and unit-cost operations.

% You cannot take the successor operation to be a unit-cost operation, nor can
% you assume that it is paired with a predecessor.

% we are dealing with words? basic data elements on any machine model?

% an element of state in a machine model. it has an initial state, and some
% succeeding states - preceding states don't really make sense.

% a successor does not lead you to another state

% at least size is not defined in terms of the number states that you've passed.

% for all classical machine models, the class of polynomial-time computable
% functions is equivalent.

% the values of any practical data structure can be recursively enumerated; so
% although the fact that a set is recursively enumerable opens a pandoras box,
% only a practical subset of it will be used in practice.

% this is an explanation of godel encoding.

% strings or states of a data structure?

% due to godel encoding, it is okay to deal in natural numbers, provided that
% we do not (necessarily) permit a unit-cost unique successor operation.

% so we're actually redefining natural numbers again? - yes.

% the natural numbers that you do have in any programming language, depend on
% the constructs available in your language. indeed, due to godel encoding, any
% practical programming languages comes with manifolds of ways of defining
% natural numbers.

% is all this because we want to deal in the natural numbers?

% In practice, we often deal with recursive sets, as by the Church-Turing thesis,
% these are  the computable functions. This makes it attractive to deal merely in
% the natural numbers as introduced above. Although this is perhaps a useful
% definition of natural numbers, the pairing of a recursively enumerable set with
% the natural numbers can be a rather complex procedure.

% We intend to model this complexity by permitting a more elaborate definition of
% natural numbers:

% \begin{notion}

% A \textbf{value} is either $0$, a successor, or a predecessor of a value. A
% successor and predecessor need not take $O(1)$ to compute.

% \end{notion}

% The notions of successor and predecessor are defined below.

% It is intentional that we do not denote the syntax of $x$.

% what is a data type?

% \begin{definition}

% The \textbf{notation} of a particular data type is a specification of how
% values of that data type may be constructed and deconstructed.

% \end{definition}

% \section{Successors}

% multiple possible successor and predecessor functions.

% TODO: define <, =, \vdash

% to define <, we need to define size; so < is defined for some measure of size.

% The rules with < occurring so early is not a problem as it is a statement
% that these rules must hold, either as part of the definition of a successor
% s, or as an admissible rule.

% \begin{definition}

% A function $s$ is a \textbf{successor} function iff

% \begin{align}
% &\vdash 0 < s(x) \\
% x < y &\vdash s(x) < s(y)
% \end{align}

% \end{definition}

% Successor functions play a key role in the remainder of the thesis, as they
% form the basis of our measure of the size of a value.

% \begin{definition}

% The \textbf{size} of a value $x$, the minimum number of successor
% applications necessary to construct $x$.

% \end{definition}

% For instance, a language $\mathcal{B}$ that uses binary notation may have two
% successors, one that doubles the value, $s_0$, and another that doubles the
% value and adds a one, $s_1$. The value $5$ is then represented in
% $\mathcal{B}$ as $s_1\p{s_0\p{s_1\p{0}}}$, and so the size of the value $5$
% in $\mathcal{B}$ is $3$. Analytically, the size of a value $x$ in
% $\mathcal{B}$ is $\ceil{\log_2\p{x}}$.

% \section{Predecessors}

% \begin{definition}

% A function $p$ is a \textbf{predecessor} function iff

% no cycles?

% \begin{align}
% &\vdash p\p{0} = 0 \\
% &\vdash p\p{x} < x & x \neq 0 \\
% x < y &\vdash p\p{x} < p\p{y}
% \end{align}

% \end{definition}

For instance, the language $\mathcal{B}$ above, may have a predecessor function
$dec$ (read: decrement) defined as follows:

\begin{align}
dec'\p{x}=y, trim\p{y}=z &\vdash dec\p{x} = z \\
dec'\p{x} = y &\vdash dec'\p{s_1\p{x}} = s_1\p{y} \\
dec''\p{x} = y &\vdash dec'\p{s_1\p{x}} = s_0\p{y} \\
dec'\p{x} = y &\vdash dec'\p{s_0\p{x}} = s_0\p{y} \\
dec''\p{x} = y &\vdash dec''\p{s_0\p{x}} = s_1\p{y} \\
&\vdash dec''\p{s_0\p{0}} = s_1\p{0} \\
&\vdash dec'\p{s_1\p{0}} = s_0\p{0} \\
&\vdash dec'\p{0} = 0 \\
trim\p{y} = z &\vdash trim\p{s_0\p{y}} = z \\
&\vdash trim\p{s_1\p{y}} = s_1\p{y} \\
&\vdash trim\p{0} = 0
\end{align}

For instance, $s_1\p{s_0\p{s_1\p{0}}}$, i.e. 5, decremented, is
$s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}$, i.e. 4:

$$
\judgement{
  \judgement{
    \judgement{
      \axiom{
        dec'\p{s_1\p{0}} = s_0\p{0}
      }
    }{
      dec'\p{s_0\p{s_1\p{0}}} = s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}
    }
  }{
    dec'\p{s_1\p{s_0\p{s_1\p{0}}}} = s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}
  }
  \quad
  \axiom{
    trim\p{s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}} = s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}
  }
}{
  dec\p{s_1\p{s_0\p{s_1\p{0}}}} = s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}
}
$$

and $s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}$, i.e. 4, decremented, is $s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}$, i.e. $3$:

$$
\judgement{
  \judgement{
    \judgement{
      \axiom{
        dec''\p{s_0\p{0}} = s_1\p{0}
      }
    }{
      dec''\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}} = s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}
    }
  }{
    dec'\p{s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}} = s_0\p{s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}}
  }
  \quad
  \judgement{
    \axiom{
      trim\p{s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}} = s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}
    }
  }{
    trim\p{s_0\p{s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}}} = s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}
  }
}{
  dec\p{s_1\p{s_0\p{s_0\p{0}}}} = s_1\p{s_1\p{0}}
}
$$

\section{Successors and predecessors}

\begin{definition}

A predecessor function $p$ is \textbf{paired} with a successor function $s$ iff

\begin{align}
\vdash p\p{s\p{x}} &= x
\end{align}

\end{definition}

It is not a requirement for a predecessor to be paired with a successor. A
language may have predecessors more powerful than any of its successors.

\begin{remark}

A successor or predecessor function may or may not take $O(1)$ time. This
depends on the machine model.

\end{remark}

\section{Primitive recursion}

\begin{definition}

A function is defined by \textbf{primitive recursion} (PR), from PR functions
$g$ and $h$, and a PR predecessor function $p$, iff

\begin{align}
f\p{0,\vect{y}} &= g\p{\vect{y}} \\
f\p{x, \vect{y}} &= h\p{x, \vect{y}, f\p{p\p{x},\vect{y}}}
\end{align}

\end{definition}

The running time of a PR function $f$, depends on the running times of $g$,
$h$, and $p$, as well as how quickly $p$ decreases $x$ to $0$.

Mere primitive recursion is not confined to polytime computation.

\begin{theorem}
PR is not confined to polytime computation.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Assume that $g$, $h$, and $p$ are all computed in $O(1)$ time.
Consider the language $\mathcal{B}$ above, having just the successors $s_0$ and
$s_1$. Let $p$ be the function $dec$ above.\end{proof}

The trouble is that $p$ does not decrease $x$ fast enough throughout the
recursion --- the number of times $p$ has to be applied to $x$ to reach $0$, is
superpolynomial in $x$.

One attempt to mitigate for this could be to have $p$ decrease the value
faster. For instance, sticking with the language $\mathcal{B}$ above, we could
let $p$ be a function that halves $x$. This would pair $p$ with $s_0$.

\begin{theorem}

Primitive recursion defined with a predecessor function which is paired with a
successor function is not confined to polytime computation.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Let a predecessor function $p$ be paired with a successor
function $s$.

Consider a function $dbl$, which doubles its input:

\begin{align}
dbl\p{0} &= 0 \\
dbl\p{x} &= s\p{s\p{dbl\p{p\p{x}}}}
\end{align}

Consider furthermore a function $iterdbl$, which calls $dbl$ iteratively, the
same number of times as the length of its input:

\begin{align}
iterdbl\p{0} &= s\p{0} \\
iterdbl\p{x} &= dbl\p{iterdbl\p{p\p{x}}}
\end{align}

Calling $iterdbl$ with a string of length $n$, we obtain a string of length
$2^n$ due to iterated doubling of the input. It follows that $iterdbl$ does a
superpolynomial amount of work in the size of its input.\end{proof}

\begin{example}
We illustrate the above proof with an example:
\begin{align}
\underline{iterdbl\p{s\p{s\p{0}}}}
  &\leadsto dbl\p{iterdbl\p{\underline{p\p{s\p{s\p{0}}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto dbl\p{\underline{iterdbl\p{s\p{0}}}} \\
  &\leadsto dbl\p{dbl\p{iterdbl\p{\underline{p\p{s\p{0}}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto dbl\p{dbl\p{\underline{iterdbl\p{0}}}} \\
  &\leadsto dbl\p{\underline{dbl\p{s\p{0}}}} \\
  &\leadsto dbl\p{s\p{s\p{dbl\p{\underline{p\p{s\p{0}}}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto dbl\p{s\p{s\p{\underline{dbl\p{0}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto \underline{dbl\p{s\p{s\p{0}}}} \\
  &\leadsto s\p{s\p{dbl\p{\underline{p\p{s\p{s\p{0}}}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto s\p{s\p{\underline{dbl\p{s\p{0}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto s\p{s\p{s\p{s\p{dbl\p{\underline{p\p{s\p{0}}}}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto s\p{s\p{s\p{s\p{\underline{dbl\p{0}}}}}} \\
  &\leadsto s\p{s\p{s\p{s\p{0}}}} \\
\end{align}
\end{example}

In the proof above, we fall prey to the admission for the function $h$ in a
primitive recursive function $f$ to generate value larger in size than its
input.

We could try to mitigate for this, but this would be getting ahead of
ourselves. Bounded primitive recursion bounds the primitive recursion in a more
general way, by bounding $f$ itself.

recursion on notation can simulate primitive recursion in the absence of any
size bounds\cite{bellantoni-phd-1992}.

From this perspective we can fit Cobham's characterization into the pattern of
most (if not all) definitions of complexity classes: one defines a general
model of computation and then cuts oôhe computation when certain resource
bounds are exceeded.

An operator is a mapping from ground terms over a signature to ground terms
over a signature. An algebra is a signature coupled with a set of operators.

The semantics of composition is given by

$$\sem{\mathtt{COMP}\p{h,g_0,g_1,\ldots,g_i}} = f$$

\begin{align*}
%
f\p{\vect{x}} = \sem{h}\p{\sem{g_0}\p{\vect{x}}, \sem{g_1}\p{\vect{x}}, \ldots,
\sem{g_i}\p{\vect{x}}}
%
\end{align*}

\section{Bounded primitive recursion on notation}

Perhaps the most obvious way to characterise \FPTIME{}, is to explicitly bound
the definable functions to be ``at most as complex to compute'' as some
polynomial in the size of the input, without further reflections on how such a
bound may be instated.

Such a general characterisation appears in the seminal conference paper
\cite{cobham-1965}, which consequently helped to establish computational
complexity theory as a field\cite{clote-1999}. The original characterisation
was given in terms of a single-sorted word signature, in particular, the
natural numbers in decimal notation. The detailed proofs that this
characterisation is indeed extensionally sound and complete, appeared later in
e.g.  \cite{rose-1984}, using decimal notation, and in \cite{tourlakis-1984,
clote-1999}, using binary notation.

\def\smashf{\ensuremath{\mathtt{\#}}}

We give the characterisation on the following terms:

\begin{definition} A \textbf{single-sorted word signature}, $\Psi$, has $n \in
\mathbb{N}$ symbols, $m \in \mathbb{N}$ of which, where $m \leq n$, are
nullary, and $\p{n-m}$ of which are unary, m.f.

$$\Psi \triangleq \set{s_1 : 0, \; \ldots, \; s_m : 0, \; s_{m+1} : 1, \;
\ldots, \; s_n : 1}.$$

\end{definition}

\begin{example} Let $B \triangleq \set{\varepsilon : 0, \; \symb{0} : 1, \;
\symb{1} : 1}$ be a single-sorted word signature for use in subsequent
examples, having the context-free grammar

$$B ::= \symb{0} \cdot B \mid \symb{1} \cdot B \mid \varepsilon$$

For instance, $\varepsilon$, $\symb{0}$, $\symb{1}\symb{0}$,
$\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}$, $\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}\symb{0}$,
are all terms over $B$.

\end{example}

\begin{definition} \label{def:single-sort-word-term-size} The size of a term $t
\in \mathcal{T}\p{\Psi}$, written $\card{t} \in \mathbb{N}$, is the cumulative
number of occurrences of symbols and variables in $t$, m.f.

\begin{align*}
\card{v_i} &= 1 & \text{for all $v_i \in Var$} \\
\card{s_i} &= 1 & \text{for all $s_i\in \Psi^0$} \\
\card{s_j\p{x}} &= \card{x} + 1 & \text{for all $s_j \in \Psi^1$}
\end{align*}

\end{definition}

\begin{example} The size of a term over $B$ is given by

\begin{align*}
\card{\varepsilon} &= 1 \\
\card{\mathtt{0} \cdot x} &= \card{x} + 1 \\
\card{\mathtt{1} \cdot x} &= \card{x} + 1
\end{align*}

For instance, $\card{\varepsilon}=1$, $\card{\symb{0}} = 2$,
$\card{\symb{1}\symb{0}} = 3$, $\card{\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}} = 4$,
$\card{\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}\symb{0}} = 7$, etc. The fact
that an empty string has a non-zero size is perhaps intuitively justifiable as
follows: even the lack of data is data in itself.

Intuitively, the terms of a single-sorted word signature $\Psi$ with $m$
nullary symbols and $\p{n-m}$ unary symbols span a forest $\mathcal{F}\p{\Psi}$
of $m$ full $\p{n-m}$-ary trees of unbounded height.

\begin{tikzpicture}[>=Stealth]
\graph[binary tree layout]{
  a -> {   
    b -> { 
      c -> { 
        d -> { e, f }, 
        g 
      }, 
    h -> { i, j }
    },
    k -> {
      l -> {
        m -> { n, o },
        p -> { q, r }
      }, 
      s -> {
        v -> {w, x},
        y -> {z}
      }
    }
  }
};
\end{tikzpicture}

The number of terms of size $i\in\mathbb{N}$ is the number of nodes of tree
depth at most $i-1$ in $\mathcal{F}\p{\Psi}$. This is the cumulative sum of the
number of nodes in $m$ full $\p{n-m}$-ary trees of height $i-1$. It is well
known that the number of nodes in a full $\p{n-m}$-ary tree of height $\p{i-1}$
is $\p{n-m}^\p{i-1}-1$. This gives in total, $m \cdot \p{\p{n-m}^\p{i-1}-1}$
terms of size $i\in\mathbb{N}$.

\end{example}

\begin{definition} Let $\mathcal{T}_\downarrow\p{\Psi}$ denote the
\textbf{ground terms} over $\Psi$. \end{definition}

\begin{definition} Let $\mathcal{T}_\downarrow\p{\Psi}^{\leq i}$ denote the ground terms
over $\Psi$ of size at most $i$, m.f.

$$\mathcal{T}_\downarrow\p{\Psi}^{\leq i} \triangleq
\set{t\in\mathcal{T}_\downarrow\p{\Psi} \st{\card{t} \leq i}}.$$

\end{definition}

The following corollary follows directly from the above definitions:

\begin{corollary}

$$\card{\mathcal{T}_\downarrow\p{\Psi}^{\leq i}} = \card{\Psi^0} +
\card{\Psi^1}^\p{i-1} = m + \p{n-m}^\p{i-1}$$

\end{corollary}

\begin{example} $\card{\mathcal{T}_\downarrow\p{B}^{\leq i}} = 1 + 2^i$.
(Recall that we also count the empty string.) \end{example}

As illustrated by \refThm{bprn-fptime-complete}, key to the
\FPTIME{}-completeness of the characterisation in \cite{cobham-1965} is to
permit the construction of a value polynomial in size in the size of the input.
That is, given a term $t \in \mathcal{T}\p{\Psi}$, we want to construct a term
$u \in \mathcal{T}\p{\Psi}$, such that $p\p{\card{t}} \leq \card{u}$, for some
polynomial

$$p\p{x}=c_1 \cdot x^{e_1} + c_2 \cdot x^{e_2} + \cdots + c_k \cdot x^{e_k}$$
 
To attain this with primitive recursion on notation, which
permits only a recursive call depth linear in the size of the input, we need a
superpolynomial mechanism called the ``smash function'': 

% \begin{definition} Let the size of a term over $\Sigma$ be the number of
% symbols involved in the construction of the term:

% \begin{align*}
% \card{v_0}        &=  0 \\
% \card{v_1\p{x}}   &=  \card{x} + 1 \\
%                  &   \vdots \\
% \card{v_{i}\p{x}} &=  \card{x} + 1
% \end{align*}

% \end{definition}

% To get a closed form for the size function, we make a simplifying assumption
% that there is at most 

% \begin{lemma} If $\Sigma$ is a single-sorted signature, then
% $\card{x}<\card{v_k\p{x}}$ for all $\p{i+1} \leq k \leq j$.  \end{lemma}

\begin{definition} The \textbf{smash function} over a single-sorted word
signature $\Psi$, with $m$ nullary and $\p{n-m}$ unary symbols, is a binary
symbol \smashf{}, written in infix notation, with the property that $\card{x
\smashf{} y} = {\card{x}\cdot\card{y}}$.\end{definition}

The usefulness of the smash function is illustrated by the fact that $\card{x
\smashf{} y} = 2^3$

\begin{example} The smash function over $B$ has the semantics $\sem{x \smashf{}
y} = 2^{\card{x} \cdot \card{y}}$. \end{example}

\begin{definition} A single-sorted word signature $\Sigma$, extended with a
smash function is $\Sigma^\smashf{} \triangleq \Sigma \cup \set { \smashf{} : 2
}$. \end{definition}

We now define the operator of bounded primitive recursion on notation, written
$\mathtt{BPRN}$, having the type:

$$\mathtt{BPRN} : \p{T \rightarrow U}^m \rightarrow \p{S \rightarrow T
\rightarrow U}^\p{n-m} \rightarrow S \rightarrow T \rightarrow U.$$

The operator has the following semantics:

$$\sem{\mathtt{BPRN}\p{g_0, \ldots, g_m, g_{m+1}, \ldots, g_n, k}} = f$$

where

\begin{align*}
f\p{c_0,y} &= \sem{g_0}\p{y} \\
          & \vdots \\
f\p{c_m,y} &= \sem{g_m}\p{y} \\
f\p{c_{m+1}\p{x},y} &= \sem{g_{m+1}}\p{x,y,f\p{x,y}} \\
          & \vdots \\
f\p{c_n\p{x},y} &= \sem{g_n}\p{x,y,f\p{x,y}} \\
f\p{x,y} &\leq \sem{k}\p{x,y}
\end{align*}

We now characterise \FPTIME{} as the function algebra
$\algebra{\Sigma^\smashf{}}{\mathtt{COMP}, \mathtt{BPRN}}$.

\begin{remark} \cite{cobham-1965} originally characterised \FPTIME{} using the
function $x^\card{y}$, i.e. $x$ concatenated with itself $\card{y}$ times, in
place of a ``smash'' function as above. Of course, in case of binary notation,
$x^\card{y} = \p{2^{\log_2{x}}}^\card{y} \leq \p{2^{\ceil{\log_2\p{x+1}}}}^\card{y}
= \p{2^\card{x}}^\card{y} = 2^{\card{x} \cdot \card{y}}$, and $x^\card{y}$ is
still not in \FPTIME{}, but we have not seen any proofs using this original
characterisation. \cite{cook-1975} uses the original characterisation, but
refers to proofs in unpublished work.  The first reference to the choice of
words ``smash function'' seems to be \cite{buss-phd-1985-6}.  \end{remark}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:bprn-fptime-sound} The algebra
$\algebra{\Sigma}{\mathtt{BPRN}}$ over a single-sorted word signature $\Sigma$
is \FPTIME{}-sound.\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} Proof by simulation by an \FPTIME{} TM. \end{proof}

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:bprn-fptime-complete} The algebra
$\algebra{\Sigma}{\mathtt{BPRN},\mathtt{\#}}$ over a single-sorted word
signature $\Sigma$ is \FPTIME{}-complete.\end{theorem}

\begin{proof} (Sketch, see also \cite{rose-1984}.) Proof by simulation of an
\FPTIME{} TM. Performing primitive recursion on notation on $u$, we can
simulate $p\p{\card{t}}$-time TM, by simulating the transition function of the
TM with the step function of the primitive recursion. \end{proof}

The crucially unsatisfying aspect of \cite{thm:bprn-fptime-complete} is that it requires a function outside \FPTIME{} to be in the.

% In 1964 Cobham [C] gave the first recursion-theoretic characterization of
% polynomial time, using a recursion whose depth was the binary length of the
% number being recursed on, and using explicit polynomial bounds to control the
% size of the output.\cite{bellantoni-phd-1992}.

Although bounded primitive recursion has led to some interesting work
\cite{cook-1975, buss-phd-1985-6, cook-urquhart-1993}, the bounds are enforced
in an ``extensional'' manner, rather than being an ``intensional'' property of
the system. This statement is intensionally vague. To put a bounded primitive
recursive function to good use, we need to \emph{prove} the bounding inequality
of the function definition. This leads to grave complications in the cited
work, but is sometimes outwitted by assuming bounded execution model, which
simply cuts off at overflow:

% recursion scheme over an inductively or coinductively defined data type (an
% algebra).

% recursion schemes in multiple variables?

% recursion scheme over   a

\begin{specification} A function $f : B \rightarrow \vect{B} \rightarrow B$
over a single-sorted word algebra over the signature $\p{\set{B},\set{B, B
\rightarrow B},\mathbf{V}}$, is given by \textbf{bounded primitive recursion on
notation} using the following recursion scheme:
 
\begin{align}
%
f\p{v_i, \vect{y}} &\leadsto g_i\p{v_i, \vect{y}} & \text{for all $\set{v_i \in
\mathbf{V} \st{ v_i : B}}$} \\
%
f\p{v_j\p{x}, \vect{y}} &\leadsto h_j\p{x, \vect{y}, f\p{x, \vect{y}}} &
\text{for all $\set{v_j \in \mathbf{V} \st{ v_j : B \rightarrow B}}$}
%
\end{align}

where for each $v_i : B$ we have $g_i : B \rightarrow \vect{B} \rightarrow B$,
and for each $v_j : B \rightarrow B$ we have $h_j : B \rightarrow \vect{B}
\rightarrow B \rightarrow B$, and lastly, there is the \emph{semantic}
requirement that $f\p{x,\vect{y}} \leq k\p{x,\vect{y}}$ for some $k : B
\rightarrow \vect{B} \rightarrow B$, for all $x \in B$.

\end{specification}

\begin{remark} It seems a bit superfluous to deal in the additional argument
vector $\vect{y}$ which we simply pass down to our base and step functions.
This could be handled by e.g. partially applying $\vect{y}$ on the given
functions.  Although not important to the recursion scheme, we will soon take
the stance that the arguments in $\vect{y}$ are of a different ``nature'' than
the arguments we recur on.\end{remark}

It seems straight forward to generalize bounded primitive recursion on notation
to many-sorted free algebras, although we have not seen others do this:

\begin{specification} Given a single-sorted algebra over the signature
$\p{\mathbf{B},\set{\rightarrow},\mathcal{C}}$, a function $f : S \rightarrow
U$ is given by \textbf{bounded primitive recursion on notation}, if it is given
by the scheme

\begin{align}
%
f\p{c_i} &\leadsto g_i\p{c_i} & \text{for all $\set{c_i \in \mathcal{C} \st{ c_i :
S}}$} \\
%
f\p{c_j\p{\vect{x}}} &\leadsto h_j\p{\vect{x}} & \text{for all $\set{c_j \in
\mathcal{C} \st{ c_j : \vect{T} \rightarrow S}}$}
%
\end{align}

where for each $c_i : S$ we have $g_i : S \rightarrow U$, and for each $c_j :
\vect{T} \rightarrow S$ we have $h_j : \vect{T} \rightarrow U$, and lastly,
there is the \emph{semantic} requirement that $f\p{s} \leq k\p{s}$ for some $k
: S \rightarrow V$.

\end{specification}

\begin{definition} A function is \textbf{bounded primitive recursive} if it is
given by an algebra closed under composition and bounded primitive recursion.
\end{definition}

\end{quotation}

That which we call ``predicative'' recursion is also referred to as
``tiered''\cite{leivant-1990}, ``stratified''\cite{leivant-1993}, or
``ramified''\cite{leivant-1995} recursion. (The conflation of these terms
appears prevalent in mathematics.) Our motivation is due to
\cite{hofmann-2000a}, categorising in one fell swoop, both the seminal works
\cite{bellantoni-cook-1992} and \cite{leivant-1995}. Hofmann was in turn
motivated by \cite{bellantoni-phd-1992}.

The use of the term ``predicative'' itself is due to \cite{russell-1907}, who
suggested a ``predicative'' theory of sets in order to deal with the paradoxes
of na\"ive set theory. Informally, the definition of an entity is
``impredicative''\cite{goedel-1944}, if it refers (directly, or indirectly) to
the entity being defined (self-reference). Two classical examples of
impredicative definitions gone rogue are the Russell's and Liar paradoxes: 

\begin{description}

\item [Russell's paradox] Define the set $R$ to be the set of all sets which
are not members of themselves. If $R$ is a member of itself, then it should not
be a member of itself; if it is not a member of itself, then it should be a
member of itself. Paradox by indirect self-reference.

\item [Liar paradox] Define the liar sentence ``This sentence is false.'' If
the sentence is true, then it is false; if it is false, then it is true.
Paradox by direct self-reference.

\end{description} 

This is achieved by ``segregating the variables''.


\subsection{Two-tiered recursion}

Two-tiered recursion is also referred to as ``safe recursion'' and was
independently introduced in \cite{simmons-1988}, \cite{leivant-1990}, and
\cite{bellantoni-cook-1992}.

\subsection{Many-tiered recursion}

The generalization of two-tiered recursion to many-tiered recursion is
generally attributed to \cite{leivant-1995}. Leivant proved his results in
terms of single-sorted word algebras.

\begin{definition} A \textbf{single-sorted} algebra is an algebra over the
signature $\p{\set{B}, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{V}}$, i.e. there is just a single
base type, $B$. \end{definition}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{word} algebra is an algebra over the signature
$\p{\mathbf{B}, \set{\rightarrow}, \mathcal{V}}$, where each $v \in
\mathcal{V}$ either has the kind $v : *$ or $v : *\rightarrow *$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} A single-sorted word algebra is an algebra over the signature
$\p{\set{B},\set{\rightarrow}, \mathcal{V}}$, where for each $v \in
\mathcal{V}$ we either have $v : B$ or $v : B\rightarrow B$. \end{example}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{Peano numbers} algebra is a single-sorted word
algebra over the signature $\p{\set{N}, \set{\rightarrow},\set{\mathtt{0} : N,
\mathtt{s} : N \rightarrow N}}$. \end{definition}


This is sufficient to deal in all finite types and string types, e.g.  the
peano numbers or binary strings. Making our way towards mixed data types and
tuples, \cite{marion-2003} generalized tiered recursion to simple algebras.
 
\begin{definition} A \textbf{simple algebra} is an algebra over the signature
$\p{\mathbf{B}, \set{\rightarrow}, \mathcal{C}}$, where each value constructor
$c \in \mathcal{C}$ has the type $\tau_1 \rightarrow \tau_2 \rightarrow \cdots
\rightarrow \tau_n \rightarrow \tau$, for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$, such that
$\tau$ occurs at most once amongst the $\tau_i$.  \end{definition}

If we curry our eyes a bit, we can see how this leads way to ``simple'' tuples.
Indeed, \cite{marion-2003} employs the more concise notation
$\p{\tau_1,\tau_2,\cdots,\tau_n}\rightarrow \tau$ instead.  Although this
admits a slightly more eloquent class of data types, we need more ``complex''
tuples to even model good old trees.

Worse yet, the results in \cite{leivant-1995} rely on a size function where the
size of a term is the ``height of the parse-tree'' of the term. Leading to the
plausible deniability that tiered recursion still captures $\mathtt{FPTIME}$
when defined over any free algebra\cite{caseiro-1996}.

The generalization to \emph{any} free algebra comes about in
\cite{dal-lago-et-al-2010}. Their insight is that there is no need to copy (or
recompute) a value if it appears more than once in a term --- we could just
\emph{refer} to the same value. In a programming language without destructive
assignment, this is perhaps a natural optimization technique. Hence ``trees''
are really represented as graphs.

\begin{remark} With this generalisation we move away from the conventional
notion of the \emph{length} of a term $t$ being the cumulative number of
occurrences of symbols and variables in $t$, as in first-order term
rewriting\cite{klop-vrijer-2003}. \end{remark}

\begin{example} \cite{dal-lago-et-al-2003} Consider a program $\p{\p{\p{N,T}, N
\cup T, \set{z : N, s : N \rightarrow N, \mathtt{leaf} : T, \mathtt{node} : T
\times T \rightarrow T}}, \set{f}}$, where $f$ is given by the following set of
clauses:

\begin{align}
f\p{\symb{z}}       &\leadsto \symb{leaf} \\
f\p{\symb{s}\p{w}}  &\leadsto \symb{node}\p{f\p{w}, f\p{w}}
\end{align}

\end{example}

\section{Non-size increasing computation}

Although it might seem proper to name this section ``impredicative recursion'',
it is perhaps too general a name for the section to end up concise. Besides,
drawing such a cleavage might charm us in the wrong direction.

We now abandon the onset that those variables we recurse on, ``are of a
different nature'', and reinstate the point of view that all values are created
equal, but do differ in size.

The insights regarding non-size increasing computation, also led to a
generalization of the results in \cite{marion-2003} in
\cite{marion-moyen-2000}. The authors replace the use of predicative recursion
by a semantic argument and show how primitive recursion over non-size
increasing base and step functions now admits e.g. LCS and insertion sort. The
results never made it past the conference, perhaps due to the use of simple
algebras in light of more generally applicable results in e.g.
\cite{aehlig-schwichtenberg-2002, hofmann-2003}.

\section{Polynomially-bounded values}
