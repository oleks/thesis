An in-depth discussion (and perhaps, generalisation) is missing for at least
two major approaches to implicitly characterising (sub)polynomial bounds:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]

\item Polynomially-Bounded Values, as in \cite{niggl-wunderlich-2006} and
\cite{jones-kristiansen-2009}.

\item Bounded Linear Logic, as in \cite{girard-scedorov-scott-1992} and
\cite{dal-lago-hofmann-2010}.

\end{enumerate}

Arguably, these are perhaps the approaches closest to our onset of looking for
ways to characterise subpolynomial bounds.
