\part{Subpolynomialism}

We turn now to the consideration of subpolynomial bounds. We wish for a
baseline system which captures polynomial time, and admits subsystems with
explicitly stated subpolynomial bounds.

For lack of a better word, we draw inspiration from the term ``colonialism''.

\begin{quotation}

Colonialism is a practice of domination, which involves the subjugation of one
people to another \ldots The term colony comes from the Latin word
\emph{colonus}, meaning farmer. This root reminds us that the practice of
colonialism usually involved the transfer of population to a new territory,
where the arrivals lived as permanent settlers while maintaining political
allegiance to their country of origin.

``Subpolynomailism'' is similar in this regard, as this too involves the
``transfer of population (programmers) to a new territory'', where they can
only write programs within a given subpolynomial bound, ``maintaining political
allegiance to their country of origin'', in the sense that they can return to
the baseline system, or move to another subsystem, for other lines of work.

We consider two approaches to subpolynomialism. The approaches differ in a
fundamental way:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The first takes a substructural approach, where we review earlier
attempts to integrate bounds into the logic of the type system itself. In
particular, we briefly review various bounded, light, and soft linear and
affine logics.

\item The second takes a substructural approach only to guarantee that a
baseline system is bounded to PTIME. Subpolynomial bounds are achieved for
subsystems by sprinkling effect types on top of this baseline system. To our
knowledge, this is a novel approach.

\end{enumerate}
