\chapter{Preface}

%In what follows, we give a philosophical ground for the remainder of the
%thesis. We start with imprecise notions, and arrive at precise definitions.
%Although it may seem like an imprecise ground at first, it is really a more
%honest ground than a purely ``precise'' ground. By stating the imprecise
%notions that our precise definitions build upon, we state the fundamental
%system belief which we deal within.
