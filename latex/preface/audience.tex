\section{Audience}

The audience of this thesis is anyone interested in the connection of
computability and complexity to the theory of programming languages. In
particular, what the admittance of particular programming language constructs
implies for the complexity of the programs that you can write.

The thesis is directed towards the level of a Computer Science graduate student
at the time of writing: The reader is assumed to be familiar with basics of
discrete mathematics and the analysis of time and space complexity of
algorithms. The reader is also assumed to be familiar with the theory of
programming languages, in particular some formal means of specifying the
syntax, and preferably also, the semantics of a programming language. The
reader is expected to be familiar with Logic in Computer Science.
