\section{Audience}

The audience of this thesis is anyone interested in the connection of
computability and complexity to the theory of programming languages. In
particular, what the admittance of particular programming language constructs
implies for the complexity of the programs that you can write.

\def\chs{\textsection\textsection}

The thesis is directed towards the level of a Computer Science graduate student
at the time of writing: The reader is assumed to be familiar with basics of
discrete mathematics. The analysis of time and space complexity of algorithms,
as in \cite{cormen-et-al-2009}, \chs1--17 and \chs21--24. The reader is also
assumed to be familiar with the theory of programming languages, in particular
some formal means of specifying the syntax, and preferably also, the semantics
of a programming language. The reader is expected to be familiar with Logic in
Computer Science.
