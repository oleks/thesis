\section{Formal Systems}

A formal system is a system of symbols and rules for manipulating them.

A formal system bears little intrinsic purpose, in the sense 

A formal system is a purely mental construction, 

A formal system $\mathcal{F}$ can be reasonably realised by a physical system
$\mathcal{P}$, provided that \begin{inparaenum}[(a)]\item there is a reasonable
correspondence between the symbols of $\mathcal{F}$ and the physical symbols of
$\mathcal{P}$, and \item $\mathcal{P}$ can manipulate the physical symbols in
reasonable accordance with the rules of $\mathcal{F}$ \end{inparaenum}.

Physical systems realising formal systems are typically referred to as
``computers''. 

Formal systems bear little intrinsic purpose, but serve as a means to specify
the desired behaviour of the physical systems that realise them.


``Reasonability'' therefore is a matter of how accurate


% instead as a means to an end for more intelligent beings. A physical system
% $\mathcal{P}$ is more reasonable in this

% Desired for the formal system: consistent & complete
% Desired for the physical system: reliable, i.e. accurate.
