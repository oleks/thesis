It is beyond the scope of thesis to justify a choice of mathematical
foundations other than \emph{classical mathematics}. This is the sort of
mathematics often taught prior to higher education, and throughout; so the
reader is assumed to be familiar with it. This choice is also natural as most
related literature assumes a classical foundation.

This is certainly not the only possible foundation of mathematics, as advocated
by various schools of \emph{constructive mathematics}. In a nutshell,
constructive mathematics takes the stance that a proof that a mathematical
object exists, constitutes specifying a way of (mentally) constructing that
object.

Although we assume a classical foundation, we will seek to keep ourselves to
constructive arguments --- the approach often taken in related literature.

\subsection{Sequences}

We begin with a brief discussion of some typographical, rather than
mathematical matters. Sequences have a particular notational significance in
the remainder of this document.

\begin{notion}

A \textbf{sequence} is a ``juxtaposition'' of \textbf{elements}.

\end{notion}

Some ``short'' sequences can be denoted typographically. For instance,

$$\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}\symb{0}\symb{1}\symb{0}$$

To make the distinction between the elements of a sequence clear, and to
distinguish various types of sequences, some sequences will appear ``separated
by'' a distinguished symbol. For instance,

$$\symb{1},\symb{0},\symb{1},\symb{0},\symb{1},\symb{0} \quad \text{or} \quad
X\rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z.$$

Some sequences will be ``too long'' to be sequenced typographically. Such
sequences will be given by stating a ``sequencing algorithm'', by which the
elements can be sequenced, one-by-one, at the reader's leisure. There need not
be a point at which we have sequenced all the elements of a sequence, and so
the reader should take care not to get carried away.

One informal way of specifying a sequencing algorithm is to typographically
sequence the first couple of elements, and to terminate the sequence by an
ellipses ($\ldots$) We then rely on the reader's intuition to deduce how the
subsequent elements are to be sequenced, one-by-one\footnote{Here, we ignore
Wittgenstein's rule-following paradox \cite[\textsection~201, p.
69]{wittgenstein-1953}.}. For instance,

$$\symb{1},\symb{0},\symb{1},\symb{0},\symb{1},\symb{0},\ldots \quad \text{or} \quad
A\rightarrow B \rightarrow C\rightarrow\cdots$$

We say that the elements of a sequence appear in a particular ``order'', and
sometimes, the elements, or sequences of elements, ``repeat'' within a
sequence. Such order and repetition will sometimes be significant.

Some sequences will be otherwise decorated to further guide the reader's
intuition about the sequence. For instance, the one-dimensional ``Turing
tape'', as discussed in \refSection{background-computability}, is a sequence of
``tape squares'' having a left edge, but extending to infinity to the right.  A
Turing tape may be illustrated as follows:
 
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \tikzset{tape/.style={minimum size=.7cm, draw}}
  \begin{scope}[start chain=0 going right, node distance=0mm]
   \foreach \x [count=\i] in {\symb{1}, \symb{0}, \symb{1}, \symb{0}, \symb{1}, \blank, \blank, \blank} {
    \ifnum\i=8 % if last node reset outer sep to 0pt
      \node [on chain=0, tape, outer sep=0pt] (n\i) {\x};
      \draw (n\i.north east) -- ++(.1,0) decorate [decoration={zigzag, segment length=.12cm, amplitude=.02cm}] {-- ($(n\i.south east)+(+.1,0)$)} -- (n\i.south east) -- cycle;
     \else
      \node [on chain=0, tape] (n\i) {\x};
     \fi
     \ifnum\i=1 % if first node draw a thick line at the left
      \draw [line width=.1cm] (n\i.north west) -- (n\i.south west);
     \fi
   }
   \node [right=.25cm of n8] {$\cdots$};
  \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\subsection{Sets}

It is beyond the scope of this thesis to develop an axiomatic theory of sets.
We assume a notion of sets as given, subject to the following specification:

\begin{specification} A \textbf{set} is a mathematical object that is distinct
from, but completely determined by its \textbf{elements}. \end{specification}

\begin{notation} By $X\triangleq Y$, read ``$X$ is by definition the same as
$Y$'', we mean that $X$ is henceforth interchangeable with $Y$, until $X$
occurs on the left side of another $\triangleq$, that is, until $X$ is
redefined. \end{notation}

A set will always be denoted enclosed in braces. For instance, the simplest set
is the empty set, having no elements. We define the empty set as follows:

\begin{definition} The \textbf{empty set}, written $\emptyset$, is

$$\emptyset\triangleq\set{}.$$

\end{definition}

Some sets can be given by denoting their elements in a typographical sequence,
separated by commas. For instance, we define the set of boolean values as follows:

\begin{definition} The set of \textbf{boolean values} is

$$\mathbb{B}\triangleq\set{\strue,\sfalse}$$

\end{definition}

Some sets have too many elements to be sequenced typographically. Some of these
``large'' sets can be given by stating an algorithm\footnote{In the informal,
mathematical sense of an algorithm, as in e.g. Egyptian multiplication.}, by
which the elements can be sequenced at the reader's leisure.  Every element of
such a set will eventually appear in the sequence, but there need not be a
point at which we have sequenced all the elements of the set.

One way of specifying such an algorithm is to typographically sequence the
first couple of elements, and to terminate this sequence by an ellipses
($\ldots$) We then rely on the reader's intuition to deduce how the subsequent
elements can be sequenced one-by-one\footnote{Here we ignore Wittgenstein's
rule-following paradox.}.

For instance, we define the set of natural numbers as follows:

\begin{definition} The set of \textbf{natural numbers} is

$$\mathbb{N} \triangleq \set{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,\ldots}.$$

\end{definition}

As we shall later prove, there are sets which have too many elements to be
sequenced by an algorithm.  Such sets will be given by a rule regarding what
constitutes an element of the set, relying ever more on the reader's intuition.
A set like this is written $\set{x\st{\text{rule regarding $x$}}}$, read ``all
$x$ such that the rule regarding $x$ holds''.

For instance, we define the set of real numbers as follows:

\begin{definition} The set of \textbf{real numbers} is

$$\mathbb{R}\triangleq\set{x\st{\text{$x$ is value along a continuous
line}}}.$$

\end{definition}

We will use typical mathematical notation to denote the elements of
$\mathbb{R}$. That is, fractions or adequate decimal expansions for the
\emph{rational numbers}, and known mathematical functions for the
\emph{irrational numbers}, e.g. $\sqrt{2}$, $\pi$, $\phi$. When adequate,
an irrational number will be given by a rational approximation.

\begin{notation} By $x\in X$, read (foreach) ``$x$ in $X$'', (if) ``$x$ is in
$X$'', or (let) ``$x$ be in $X$'',  for some set $X$, we mean that $x$ shall
henceforth refer to an element of $X$, if any. \end{notation}

% Russel's paradox comes after functions, predicates and the last step of
% set-builder notation with such that rules.

\subsection{Functions}

For the lack of an axiomatic approach to the notion of sets, we also take a
notion of functions as given, subject to the following specification:

\begin{specification} A \textbf{function} is either

\begin{enumerate}

\item a \textbf{partial function} $f$ with a \textbf{domain} $X$, and
\textbf{codomain} $Y$, written $f:X\rightharpoonup Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are
sets, and

\begin{enumerate}

\item for each $x\in X$, $f$ either has a \textbf{value} at $x$ in $Y$, written
$f\p{x}\in Y$, or $f\p{x}$ is undefined;

\item $X$, $Y$, and $f\p{x}$ for each $x\in X$ are completely determined by $f$;

\item $X$, $Y$, and $f\p{x}$ for some $x\in X$ are completely determine $f$; or

\end{enumerate}

\item a \textbf{constant} $\overline{x}$, where $x\in X$, for some nonempty set
$X$, written $\overline{x}:X$, with domain $X$, written $x:X$, where $X$ is a
nonempty set.

\end{enumerate}

\end{specification}

\begin{definition} A function is \textbf{total}, if it is either a constant, or
a partial function $f:X\rightharpoonup Y$, where $f\p{x}$ is defined for all
$x\in X$, written $f:X\rightarrow Y$.\end{definition}

For the lack of a formal definition of either sets or partial functions, but in
tune with the specifications of these notions above, we can regard partial
functions as sets. In such an interpretation, the codomain (and domain) of a
partial function may itself be a partial function. This leads way to some
convenient notation:

\begin{notation} A partial function $f:X\rightharpoonup G$, where $G$ is a
function $g:Y\rightharpoonup Z$ is also written $f:X\rightharpoonup
\p{Y\rightharpoonup Z}$, or simply $f:X\rightharpoonup Y\rightharpoonup Z$.
Similarly for total functions.  \end{notation}

\def\codomain#1{co\textsuperscript{$#1$}domain}

\begin{notation} For a function $f:X_0\rightharpoonup X_1 \rightharpoonup
\cdots \rightharpoonup X_n \rightharpoonup Y$, for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we
say $Y$ is the \codomain{n} of $f$, and $f$ has $n$ \textbf{arguments}, or $f$
is an $n$-argument function, and furthermore

\begin{itemize}

\item $f$ is \textbf{nullary} if it has $0$ arguments;

\item $f$ is \textbf{unary} if it has $1$ argument;

\item $f$ is \textbf{binary} if it has $2$ arguments.

\end{itemize}

\end{notation}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{relation} is a total binary function with a
\codomain{2} $\mathbb{B}$. \end{definition}

\begin{notation} When denoted by a symbol, the application of a relation will
sometimes be denoted in infix notation. \end{notation}

\begin{notation} By $=$, we denote the \textbf{equality relation}.
\end{notation}

 A partial function can hereby be given by a set of mappings,
where a mapping from $x$ to $f\p{x}$ is written $x\mapsto f\p{x}$.

\begin{definition} A function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a \textbf{bijection}, or
``is bijective'', iff there exists a function $g:Y\rightarrow X$ such that for
each $x\in X$, $g\p{f\p{\overline{x}}}=\overline{x}$. \end{definition}

\subsection{Cardinality}

The \textbf{cardinality} of a set $X$, written $\card{X}$, is a measure of its
size. Two sets $X$ and $Y$ have the same cardinality, written
$\card{X}=\card{Y}$, if there exists a bijective function $f:X\rightarrow Y$.

\begin{notation} When we consider an element $a$ of a set $A$, we write $a\in
A$. \end{notation}

\begin{definition} The \textbf{union} of sets $A$ and $B$, written $A\cup B$,
is the set of all $a\in A$ and all $b\in B$. \end{definition}

\begin{specification} A \textbf{property} is a mathematical statement that is
either true or false. \end{specification}

\begin{definition} A set $X$, is \textbf{enumerable} iff
$\card{X}\leq\card{\mathbb{N}}$. \end{definition}

%\begin{definition}

%A \textbf{language} $\mathcal{L}=\chev{\mathcal{C},\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{R}}$
%is given by specifying a set of constant symbols $\mathcal{C}$, a set of
%function symbols $\mathcal{F}$, and a set of relation symbols $\mathcal{R}$.

%\end{definition}

% a sequence is something formed by the concatenation of elements.

%\begin{definition}

%A \textbf{string} is a finite sequence of elements drawn from an alphabet.

%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}

%A \textbf{string language} is a set of \textbf{strings}.

%\end{definition}

%..

%\begin{definition}

%A \textbf{closure} of $A$ under the operations $O$, is the smallest class $C$,
%containing $A$, and such that the operations of $O$, operating on elements of
%$C$ yield elements of $C$.

%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}

%A \textbf{function algebra} is a closure of a class $A$.

%\end{definition}

%\begin{definition}

%A characteristic function 

%\end{definition}

\subsection{Tuples}

\begin{notation} We denote a tuple by listing the elements separated by commas,
and enclosed in parentheses. We use this notation out of inspiration from
Haskell syntax. We can regard this as in line with regular mathematical
notation as the arguments to a non-curried function are typically passed in
parentheses. That is unless a more convenient notation is given for particular
kinds of tuples, e.g. the configurations of a Turing machine.\end{notation}

\subsection{Strings and Languages}

\begin{definition} An \textbf{alphabet} is a finite, nonempty set of
\textbf{symbols}.  \end{definition}

\begin{definition} A \textbf{string} over an alphabet is a finite sequence of
symbols from that alphabet. \end{definition}

%\begin{notation} We take $b\notin A$ to mean the same as $\set{b}\cup A =
%\emptyset$. \end{notation}
