\section{Audience}

The audience of this thesis is anyone interested in the connection of
computability and complexity to the theory of programming languages. In
particular, what the admittance of particular programming language constructs
implies for the complexity of the programs that you can write.

\def\chs{\textsection\textsection}

The thesis is directed towards the level of a Computer Science graduate student
at the time of writing: The reader is assumed to be familiar with the basics of
discrete mathematics, as in \cite{graham-et-al-1998}. The analysis of time and
space complexity of algorithms, as in \cite{cormen-et-al-2009}, \chs1--17 and
\chs21--24. Regular and context-free languages, as in \cite{sipser-2013}
\chs1--2, and their use for programming language design, as in
\cite{mogensen-2010}. The reader should also be familiar with Logic in Computer
Science, as in \cite{huth-ryan-2004}, \chs1--4.
